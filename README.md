# Our development process and problem-solving strategy
We began this full-stack project by implementing the back-end. All four of us
(Dahnaya, Ripley, Stephanie, Susan) worked together to unzip the template,
make the updates necessary to set up the project, create the git repo, push
the initial commit to git, and deploy to heroku.
Once the basic project was set up, we created the Contents resource to store
the information about Web Pages and Blog Posts.  We also created curl scripts
to test the routes (CRUD). Once the CRUD operations were tested and we knew
the API was working as expected, we merged our code and deployed it to
heroku again.  We pretty much finished all of that on the first day.
Later Stephanie and Susan worked on getting a user document by email address
so that we could allow visitors to enter an email address of a user that had
created contents and view that content without logging in.
